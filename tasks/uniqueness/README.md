## UNIQUENESS (1 POINT)

`set` `union` `diff`

### Task

Write 3 functions `union`, `diff`, and `sym_diff` that take two lists of integers and return their union (unique elements in either list), difference (elements that are in the first list but not the second), and symmetric difference (elements that are in one list but not both), respectively.
* Use **set** only

### Example

```python
>>> union([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])
{1, 2, 3, 4}

>>> sym_diff([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])
{1, 4}
```
