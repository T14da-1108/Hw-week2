## REVERSE DICTIONARY (2 POINTS)

`dict` `defaultdict`

### Task

Write a function that inverts a dictionary. That is, the values become keys, and the keys become a list of values.

* Do not mutate the input dictionary
* If you use `defaultdict`, you should convert it to `dict` upon return
* The order of elements in the lists does not matter
* Asymptotics - O(n)

### Example

```python
>>>revert({"a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "1"})
{"1": ["a", "c"], "2": ["b"]})
```

### About the Task

You need to learn to very easily manipulate dictionaries, because they are almost always needed.
